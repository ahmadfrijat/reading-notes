# what we learned in class03 : 


## In general, your code should reflect that:
   * HTML is responsible for structuring content
   * CSS is responsible for presentation 
   * JavaScript is responsible for behavior

* Enforcing this separation produces code that is
easier to maintain and reuse. While this may already
be a familiar concept to you, it's important to
remember as it is very easy to mix these concerns in
with your JavaScript. As a rule, editing your HTML
templates or stylesheets should not necessitate
editing your scripts and vice versa.
